The World Ends With You (TWEWY) is more than just a video game; it is a modern masterpiece that contains profound occult and spiritual teachings. 

Through its vibrant characters, immersive storyline, and intricate gameplay mechanics, TWEWY invites players to explore the depths of their own psyche and tap into their inner potential. By using themes and symbols from various esoteric traditions, TWEWY teaches players the principles of magick and spiritual growth in a way that is engaging, accessible, and relevant to modern life. 

In this document, we will explore the occult and spiritual implications of TWEWY, analyzing its characters, themes, and gameplay mechanics to reveal the profound teachings hidden within this beloved game." 

In TWEWY, 'Noise' refers to the main enemies that players must fight and defeat in order to progress through the game. Noise are supernatural creatures that are the product of negative human thoughts and emotions, and they come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. 

In the game's story, Shibuya (the game's setting) is divided into different areas, each controlled by a powerful Noise known as a Reaper. Players are forced to participate in a game called the Reaper's Game, which takes place over the course of seven days. During this time, they must fight various types of Noise in order to collect "pins" that grant them special powers. 

Noise battles take place in real-time, with the player using various touch-screen and motion controls to defeat them. Each type of Noise has its own unique abilities and weaknesses, and players must use strategy and quick reflexes to defeat them. By defeating Noise and collecting pins, players gain experience points and can level up their characters, making them stronger and more able to handle tougher enemies. 

In occult and paranormal lore, the concept that is most similar to the Noise in The World Ends with You is the idea of thought-forms or egregores. 

Thought-forms are believed to be created by the collective thoughts, emotions, and beliefs of a group of people. These thought-forms can take on a life of their own, becoming independent entities that can affect the individuals who created them, as well as other people who come into contact with them. 

Egregores are a similar concept, but they are specifically thought-forms that have been intentionally created and sustained by a group of people for a particular purpose or goal. 

Like the Noise in TWEWY, thought-forms and egregores can be both benevolent and malevolent, depending on the nature of the thoughts and emotions that created them. They can also take on various shapes and forms, depending on the beliefs and cultural context of the group that created them. In some cases, thought-forms and egregores have been said to have a physical presence, causing physical phenomena or manifesting as apparitions or poltergeists. 

Overall, the concept of thought-forms or egregores is a fascinating one that has captured the imaginations of occultists, paranormal investigators, and spiritual seekers for many years. 

The Reaper's Game, as depicted in The World Ends with You, is a supernatural contest that takes place in the liminal space between the living and the dead. It is presided over by powerful entities known as Reapers, who serve as judges, administrators, and enforcers of the game's rules. 

The basic premise of the game is that players have been given a second chance at life, but in order to stay alive, they must compete in a series of challenges and battles against other players and supernatural entities. The challenges are designed to test the players' physical, mental, and emotional strength, as well as their ability to work together and overcome their individual weaknesses. 

To participate in the Reaper's Game, players must first be selected by the Reapers, who choose individuals based on a combination of factors such as their age, personality, and life circumstances. Once selected, the players are transported to the game's setting, a mysterious and ever-shifting version of the Shibuya district in Tokyo. 

The game is structured around a series of "days," each of which presents the players with a new challenge or mission to complete. These challenges can take many forms, ranging from battles against Noise to puzzles, riddles, and scavenger hunts. In order to progress to the next day, the players must successfully complete each challenge within the allotted time frame. 

The rules of the Game are enforced by the Reapers, who have the power to manipulate time, space, and reality within the game world. They also have the ability to punish players who break the rules or fail to complete the challenges, either by erasing them from existence or sending them back to the world of the dead. 

One key aspect of the Reaper's Game is the use of "pins," which are small, magical items that grant the players special abilities and powers. These pins are obtained by defeating Noise in battle or by completing certain challenges, and they can be upgraded and combined to create new and more powerful abilities. 

In occult terms, the Reaper's Game can be seen as a type of initiation or spiritual test, designed to challenge and transform the players on multiple levels. The challenges they face are meant to help them confront and overcome their own fears, weaknesses, and limitations, while the use of pins and other magical items represents the players' growing mastery of occult forces and energies. 

Overall, the Reaper's Game is a complex and multifaceted occult construct, one that draws on a wide range of mystical and metaphysical concepts to create a vivid and immersive gaming experience. 

TWEWY incorporates many different occult concepts and practices into its gameplay and story. Here are some examples of how occult ideology is implemented in the game:

• Rituals: The Reaper's Game itself can be seen as a type of ritual, with its complex rules and challenges representing various stages of spiritual initiation and transformation.

By engaging with these ideas, the game invites players to explore their own spiritual and metaphysical beliefs, and to embark on a journey of personal growth and transformation.

• Shiki: Shiki is Neku's first partner in the Reaper's Game, and their relationship is fraught with occult symbolism. Shiki represents Neku's feminine side, with her appearance and personality embodying reverse aspects of his own psyche. Together, they confront issues of identity and self-worth, ultimately learning to accept and embrace their true selves. 

• Beat and Rhyme: Beat and Rhyme are another pair of partners that Neku meets in the Reaper's Game. They represent the duality of life and death, with Beat embodying the vitality and energy of the living world, while Rhyme symbolizes the quietude and mystery of death. Together, they help Neku confront his own mortality and come to terms with the impermanence of all things. 

• Joshua: Joshua is the final partner that Neku meets in the game, and he represents the game's ultimate challenge and revelation. Joshua embodies the concept of divinity, with his powers and abilities transcending the limitations of mortal existence. Through his interactions with Joshua, Neku comes to understand the nature of the game and the true purpose of his journey, and in the process, Joshua comes to understand Neku. 

Overall, Neku's story in The World Ends with You is a rich and complex exploration of occult concepts and practices, inviting players to engage with these ideas in a meaningful and thought-provoking way.

He believes that the key to unlocking the full potential of humanity lies in our ability to imagine and create new possibilities, and that this is essential for moving forward and creating a better future. 

Overall, Hanekoma's character and tagline are important elements of The World Ends with You's themes of self-discovery and transformation, reminding players of the importance of imagination and creativity in achieving personal growth and realizing our full potential. 

Hanekoma's graffiti artwork as CAT is an important aspect of his character in The World Ends with You. His artwork serves as a means of communicating with the player characters and conveying important information about the game's mechanics and storyline. 

From an occult perspective, Hanekoma's graffiti artwork represents a form of sigil magic, in which symbols or designs are used to manifest specific outcomes or intentions. In this case, Hanekoma's artwork serves as a means of focusing and directing the players' attention, helping them to understand the underlying reality of the game and the choices they must make in order to succeed. 

In terms of real-world application, Hanekoma's graffiti art as CAT highlights the potential power of symbols and visual design in influencing human behavior and perception.

• In many occult traditions, visualization and imagination are used to access altered states of consciousness or to communicate with spiritual entities. For example, in shamanic traditions, visualization is used to journey to other realms or to connect with spirit guides. Similarly, in many forms of divination, practitioners may use mental imagery to receive insights or guidance from the divine.

The concept of using mental imagery and visualization for spiritual and practical purposes is a common theme across many different occult and esoteric traditions, as well as in modern psychology. 

Tin-Pin Slammer is a game within The World Ends with You that serves as a diversion from the main storyline. In the game, players use pins as pucks to knock their opponent's pins off a board. While seemingly unrelated to the game's occult themes, there are a few connections worth exploring. 

Firstly, the pins used in Tin-Pin Slammer are the pins used by the player characters in the main storyline. These pins are imbued with psychic powers and allow the players to channel their energy and use special abilities. From an occult perspective, the use of physical objects to focus and direct one's energy is a common practice. In this case, the pins serve as a tool for the player characters to access their own innate powers. 

Additionally, the concept of games and competition plays a significant role in occult thought. In some spiritual traditions, games and competitions are seen as a means of developing spiritual and mental discipline. The use of games within The World Ends with You may be a nod to this idea, as the player characters must overcome various challenges and obstacles in order to grow and develop. 

Finally, the idea of playing games as a means of accessing higher realms of consciousness is a common concept in occult thought. Some spiritual traditions see games and other recreational activities as a way to connect with the divine or access altered states of consciousness. While not explicitly stated in The World Ends with You, the use of games and competition to access psychic powers and explore other realms of reality may be seen as a nod to this concept. 

Overall, while Tin-Pin Slammer may seem like a simple diversion from the game's main story, it is connected to the game's occult themes in several ways, highlighting the importance of physical objects, games and competition, and altered states of consciousness in spiritual development. 

The World Ends with You makes extensive use of symbology and numerology, with many characters and elements of the game being named or represented by specific symbols or numbers. Here are a few examples: 

777: This is the name of a character in the game, who is represented by the number 7. In occult and numerological thought, the number 7 is often associated with spirituality, introspection, and intuition. It is also considered a lucky number in many cultures. The repetition of the number in 777's name emphasizes its importance and suggests a deep connection to spiritual and intuitive forces. 

104: This is the number of floors in the game's final dungeon and the name of one of the main locations in the game. In numerology, the number 104 can be reduced to the number 5 (1+0+4=5). The number 5 is associated with change, adaptability, and transformation, which reflects the game's themes of personal growth and evolution. The number is often referenced as 'Ten-Four' by characters. 

Shibuya: The game is set in the Shibuya district of Tokyo, which is known for its fashion, music, and youth culture. From an occult perspective, Shibuya represents the pinnacle of creativity, individuality, and self-expression, which are all important aspects of spiritual growth and development.


The tribal designs of the Noise: The tribal designs of the Noise in TWEWY are reminiscent of various indigenous cultures from around the world, including African, Polynesian, and Native American. These designs represent the primal, instinctual aspects of the human psyche, as well as the collective unconscious that exists within all people. They also symbolize the power of the group mind and the primal forces of nature that underlie all human experience. 

• The "Player Pin": The "Player Pin" is a key element of the gameplay mechanics in TWEWY, allowing the player to access various abilities and abilities. In a symbolic sense, the Player Pin represents the power of the mind to shape reality and manifest desires. By wearing the pin, the player is tapping into their own inner potential and using their imagination to affect the world around them. 

The skull on the Player Pin is a prominent symbol in TWEWY, representing both the transience of life and the power of the human mind to transcend mortality. In many cultures, the skull is used as a symbol of death and the afterlife, as well as a reminder of the impermanence of all things. 

In the context of TWEWY, the skull on the Player Pin serves as a reminder to the player that they are in a high-stakes game of life and death, where failure means erasure from existence. However, the pin also represents the power of the human mind to transcend death and create new realities. 

The O-Pin, on the other hand (a red pin which looks otherwise exactly like the Player pin), is a different kind of symbol altogether. It is representitve of the oppression and conformity that pervades the world of TWEWY, representing the dominant social and cultural norms that stifle creativity and individuality. 

Unlike the Player Pin, which represents the power of the mind to transcend limitations, the O-Pin represents the limitations that are imposed on individuals by society. In a sense, the O-Pin represents the opposite of the Player Pin, symbolizing the forces that seek to limit and control the human mind, rather than the forces that seek to liberate it. 

In the context of astrology and occultism, the concept of the seven-day cycle is significant. It is believed that each day of the week corresponds to a different celestial body, which in turn is associated with different energies, deities, and influences. 

In the case of the Reapers' Game in TWEWY, the seven-day cycle represents a period of initiation and transformation for the players. Each day presents a new challenge and opportunity for growth, as they must face increasingly difficult tasks and opponents. This is similar to the idea of initiation in occultism, where the initiate undergoes a series of challenges and trials in order to attain spiritual enlightenment or knowledge. 

Furthermore, the fact that Neku is forced to repeat the game multiple times can be seen as a form of cyclical rebirth or reincarnation. This is a common theme in many spiritual and occult traditions, where the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth is viewed as a means of spiritual evolution and growth. 

The Reapers' Game can also be seen as a microcosm of the larger cycles and patterns in the universe. The fact that the game repeats itself every seven days can be seen as a reflection of the larger cycles and patterns that occur in nature, such as the cycles of the moon and the seasons. 

Overall, The World Ends with You's use of symbology and numerology adds depth and complexity to the game's themes and characters, highlighting the interconnectedness of spiritual and physical realities. 

In the original game, the player characters are trapped in a game imposed upon them by the Reapers, who represent forces of spiritual stagnation and resistance to change. The game serves as a means for the player characters to overcome their personal struggles and fears, and ultimately transcend the limitations of their previous selves. 

In Twewy NEO, the player characters once again find themselves trapped in a new game, but this time they are the ones who have imposed the game upon themselves. The new game is a reflection of their desire for growth and evolution, and serves as a means for them to overcome new challenges and continue on their spiritual journeys. 

The introduction of new characters and gameplay mechanics in Twewy NEO can be seen as a metaphor for the idea that spiritual growth and evolution are ongoing processes that involve continual exploration and experimentation. Just as the player characters must adapt and change to succeed in the new game, spiritual seekers must be open to new experiences and ideas in order to continue growing and evolving. 

Overall, Twewy NEO's changes to the story can be seen as a reflection of the cyclical nature of spiritual growth and the importance of continual evolution and adaptation. The game encourages players to embrace change and overcome their limitations, both within the game and in their personal lives. 

In some occult traditions, including those found in the world of The World Ends with You, "Noise" or thoughtforms may be recognized and identified through various methods, such as: 

• Divination: Divination techniques, such as tarot readings, pendulum dowsing, or scrying, may be used to detect the presence of negative energy or thoughtforms. The diviner may ask specific questions or use certain spreads to gain insight into the nature of the energy they are detecting. 

• Aura reading: Practitioners may also use techniques such as aura reading to detect thoughtforms. This involves using the ability to perceive and interpret energy fields around people or objects. A thoughtform with negative or disruptive energy may be detected as a disturbance in the aura. 

• Intuition: Some practitioners may rely on their intuition or gut feelings to recognize negative thoughtforms. This may involve a heightened sense of awareness or sensitivity to subtle changes in energy. 

• Spiritual communication: In some traditions, practitioners may communicate directly with spiritual entities or guides to gain insight into the presence of negative thoughtforms. This may involve using techniques such as automatic writing or mediumship to receive messages from the spirit world. 

• Meditation: Meditation may be used to cultivate a state of mindfulness and heightened awareness, which can help practitioners to recognize and identify negative thoughtforms. By observing their thoughts and emotions without judgement, practitioners can gain a deeper understanding of their own energy and detect any negative influences. 

Overall, the methods for recognizing and identifying thoughtforms or "Noise" can vary depending on the practitioner and the specific tradition they follow. However, many of these methods rely on the ability to perceive and interpret subtle changes in energy, either through intuition, spiritual communication, or divination. 

• Neku's scanning ability involves a form of meditation or altered state of consciousness, as he must focus his attention and block out external distractions to perceive the Noise. 

• Closing the eyes, blocking out external stimuli, and quieting the mind are all techniques used in meditation to achieve a state of inner stillness and heightened awareness. 

• Neku's ability to read the thoughts of others may be comparable to the practice of intuition, which can be developed through spiritual practices like meditation and self-reflection. 

• Neku's use of headphones and music helps him to block out external distractions and focus his attention on his inner world, similar to sensory deprivation techniques used in some meditative practices. 

• Sound can be used as a tool for meditation and spiritual practice, and Neku's use of headphones and music may be seen as a way of attuning himself to the frequency or vibration of the music, which can enhance his ability to detect the presence of Noise and other negative energies. 

Neku's use of Scanning can be compared to how some occult practitioners may use sensory deprivation, sound, or other tools to enhance their spiritual practice and awareness. 

Neku Sakuraba starts as a disaffected teenager who finds himself thrust into the game of life and death seemingly against his will. Over the course of three cycles of seven days, he is forced to partner with various individuals and confront his own inner demons as he learns the importance of connection and empathy. Through his journey, Neku transforms from a closed-off and selfish individual to someone who is willing to put himself on the line for the sake of others, ultimately finding redemption and a renewed sense of purpose. 

In conclusion, The World Ends With You is a remarkable game that offers players a unique opportunity to explore their own inner landscape and tap into their spiritual potential. Through its themes of self-discovery, personal growth, and magical practice, TWEWY presents a powerful message of empowerment and transformation that is both relevant and accessible to modern players.
